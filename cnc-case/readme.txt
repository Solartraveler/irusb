The files are made with FreeCAD 0.18
The default tool is a 2mm miller and the case to be milled a TEKO 10006.
The X,Y zero point of reference is the holding place for the pcb near the USB connector.
The Z zero heigh is the lowest part of the case.

Things which can be improved:
The USB cutout is a little bit too small. Maybe 0.5mm on each side.
On the top side of the case, the pcb holding places need to be removed to avoid collision with D2 and J3. This could be added to the miling, to avoid manual removal.
